# Overview

Welcome to QuickEase 2.0's official documentation! We're glad to walk you through every process and give you a complete reference for this project as much as possible.

## What is QuickEase 2.0?

QuickEase 2.0 is an intelligent, AI-powered study helper app built as an enhanced version of the original QuickEase v1 by Caingles et al. (2024). Designed to alleviate students’ academic challenges, the app focuses on personalized learning—adapting to individual study habits and needs—while allowing students the autonomy to learn at their own pace.
With the addition of Forums, a new feature introduced in this version, QuickEase 2.0 fosters peer collaboration, transforming the platform into an all-in-one learning environment.

QuickEase 2.0 is not only for students, it is also useful for educators seeking to enhance learning engagement and support.

### Technology Stack

QuickEase 2.0 is built on a full-stack Node.js runtime. The frontend uses modern React frameworks (Vite for web and Expo React Native for mobile), while the backend runs on Fastify. Data persistence is managed with PostgreSQL, using Prisma Client as the ORM.
